 This routine was written for Cache that runs on a Windows PC.

 It can probably be modified to run in a Cache VMS environment by asking the user for a directory
 to put the .m files into and replacing the literal "GTM/" with that variable.

 Create a GTM folder in the root folder of the namespace that this routine runs in.

 Run ^LTUGTM to specify which routines to convert.

 Run ALL^LTUGTM to have the utility convert all routines in the namespace from A to ZZZZZZZ.
